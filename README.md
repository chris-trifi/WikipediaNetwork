# WikipediaNetwork 🌐

I wrote a Python script that generates a directed graph (**G**), featuring article titles from Wikipedia as its nodes. Each edge (**u**, **v**) signifies a direct hyperlink connection, where navigating from the article titled **u** leads directly to article **v**.

For my analysis, I initiated the exploration with the article "Gödel's incompleteness theorems." Utilizing the networkx library and gephi, I unearthed valuable insights into the nature of Wikipedia hyperlink networks and gained important information about the chosen topic.

📊 **Analysis Highlights:**
- Studied the network using the networkx library and gephi.
- Uncovered details about how Wikipedia hyperlinks form intricate networks.
- Explored the relationship of the initial article, "Gödel's incompleteness theorems" to other concepts in Philosophy, Mathematics and Formal Logic.
- 
👁️ **Visual Insight:**
- View the gephi-generated network visualization on the third page of the [Greek Presentation & Analysis file](greek_Presentation&analysis.pdf).

Enjoy the captivating dynamics of knowledge representation through hyperlinks, in the interconnected world of Wikipedia articles !
